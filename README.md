# Water Earth Fire Air

Water Earth Fire Air is a creative spin on the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors, inspired by the beloved universe of Avatar: The Last Airbender. This game draws from the rich lore of the Avatar Cycle, which dictates the order in which the Avatars are born into one of the Four Nations: Water, Earth, Fire, or Air. The cycle also represents the sequence in which each Avatar is destined to master the four elements.


Game Concept
In this game, each element (Water, Earth, Fire, and Air) competes based on the Avatar Cycle. The cycle is central to the gameplay, influencing the rules and outcomes of each match. The picture below provides a visual representation of the Avatar Cycle:

Rules
The rules of the game are simple and closely follow the Avatar Cycle:

- Water beats Earth
- Earth beats Fire
- Fire beats Air
- Air beats Water


Tie Scenarios
There are two types of ties in this game:

- Identical Elements: When both players choose the same element (e.g., Water vs. Water).
- Opposite Elements: When the elements are opposite in the Avatar Cycle (e.g., Water vs. Fire or Earth vs. Air).


How to Play

- Choose your element: Water, Earth, Fire, or Air.
- The computer will choose theirs.
- The round winner is determined based on the rules above, or a tie is declared in specific scenarios.
- Each time a player wins a round, they score a point. The first to score 5 points wins the match.
